        Aggregates group Entities and Value Objects into cohesive units of consistency. They enforce domain rules, manage state changes, and act as transactional boundaries.

      <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-6">What are Aggregates?</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-300 text-center leading-relaxed mb-8">
        An Aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that are treated as a single unit. It is defined by:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <li><strong>Aggregate Root:</strong> The main Entity that controls access to other members of the Aggregate.</li>
        <li><strong>Boundary of Consistency:</strong> All changes within an Aggregate must maintain domain rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Transaction Scope:</strong> Operations within an Aggregate are performed atomically.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-300 text-center leading-relaxed">
        Aggregates simplify complex domain logic by encapsulating related objects and ensuring consistency.

      <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-6">Characteristics of Good Aggregate Design</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-300 text-center leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Designing Aggregates effectively requires understanding the domain rules and usage patterns. Here are some key principles:
      </p>
      <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
        <!-- Principle 1 -->
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded shadow">
          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">1. Define a Clear Root</h4>
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            The Aggregate Root is the primary Entity responsible for managing the state and behavior of the Aggregate.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4"><strong>Example:</strong> In a Certification Aggregate, the Certification Entity is the root, managing linked Value Objects like dates.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Principle 2 -->
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded shadow">
          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">2. Maintain Invariant Rules</h4>
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Ensure domain rules are enforced consistently within the Aggregate boundary.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4"><strong>Example:</strong> A Course Aggregate ensures all lessons are completed before marking the course as completed.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Principle 3 -->
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded shadow">
          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">3. Avoid Over-Complex Aggregates</h4>
          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Keep Aggregates small and focused to simplify state management and reduce the likelihood of contention in transactional systems.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4"><strong>Example:</strong> Separate Learner progress tracking into its own Aggregate instead of embedding it into the Course Aggregate.</p>
        </div>

      <p class="text-gray-300 text-center leading-relaxed mb-8">
        At Kalkomey, Aggregates help model domain concepts like Courses, Certifications, and Learners. Here’s how they are used:
      </p>
      <div class="bg-gray-700 p-6 rounded text-green-400 text-sm overflow-auto">
<pre class="bg-gray-900 p-4 rounded text-green-400">
Aggregate: Certification
- Root: Certification Entity.
- Includes: Issue Date, Expiration Date (Value Objects).
- Enforces: Expiration cannot precede Issue Date, only valid Certifications can be renewed.

Aggregate: Course
- Root: Course Entity.
- Includes: Lessons (Entities), Fee (Value Object).
- Enforces: Lessons must be completed in order, Fee must be paid before enrollment.

Aggregate: Learner
- Root: Learner Entity.
- Includes: Profile Information (Value Objects), Enrollments (Entities).
- Enforces: A learner cannot enroll in a course without prerequisites.
</pre>
      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-300 text-center mt-6">
        These Aggregates ensure domain rules are consistently applied while keeping the model manageable.
