      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What is Domain-Driven Design?</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that prioritizes the domain (business logic) as the center of all design and development efforts.
        It’s about building a shared understanding of the problem space and aligning technical solutions with real-world needs.
        By focusing on the domain, DDD enables better collaboration between developers and domain experts, leading to systems that are more maintainable, flexible, and aligned with business goals.

      <!-- Bounded Context -->
      <div class="mb-8">
        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Bounded Context</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          A <strong>Bounded Context</strong> defines the boundaries within which a specific domain model is valid.
          It ensures clarity by limiting the scope of a model to its context. In complex systems, different parts of the business may use similar terms with slightly different meanings.
          Bounded Contexts help avoid confusion by isolating models and their meanings.
        </p>
        <pre class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded text-green-400 text-sm overflow-auto">
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
|  User Management  |       |   Order Service   |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
| - User Entity     |<----->| - Order Entity    |
| - Authentication  |       | - Payment         |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
        </pre>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mt-2">
          In this example, "User Management" and "Order Service" are distinct contexts, even though they share related entities. By separating concerns, changes in one context do not inadvertently affect the other.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Ubiquitous Language -->
      <div class="mb-8">
        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Ubiquitous Language</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          A <strong>Ubiquitous Language</strong> is a shared vocabulary used by both developers and domain experts to ensure clear communication.
          This language is embedded into the code, tests, and discussions, acting as a bridge between technical and business teams.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded text-gray-300 italic">
          "The model is the backbone of the ubiquitous language." - Eric Evans
        </blockquote>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mt-2">
          For instance, in a banking application, terms like "Account Holder," "Transaction," and "Ledger" would be part of the ubiquitous language.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Aggregates -->
      <div class="mb-8">
        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Aggregates</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          An <strong>Aggregate</strong> is a cluster of domain objects that are treated as a single unit for data changes.
          One entity, called the Aggregate Root, is the entry point for interacting with the aggregate. Aggregates enforce invariants to ensure consistent state.
        </p>
        <pre class="bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded text-green-400 text-sm overflow-auto">
+-----------------+
| Order (Root)    |
+-----------------+
| - Line Items    |
| - Total Amount  |
+-----------------+
        </pre>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mt-2">
          In this example, the "Order" aggregate includes "Line Items" and "Total Amount." The aggregate root ensures business rules like "Total Amount must equal the sum of Line Items."
        </p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section class="mb-12">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why DDD Matters</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        DDD is not just about building software; it’s about aligning teams, uncovering the essence of a problem, and delivering value.
        By focusing on the domain, teams can reduce technical debt, improve collaboration, and create systems that are robust and adaptable to change.
