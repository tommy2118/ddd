      <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6">
        A Bounded Context is a core concept in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) that defines a clear boundary around a specific domain model.
        It ensures consistency of language, behavior, and rules within that boundary while isolating it from others.

      <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-6">Understanding Bounded Contexts</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        A Bounded Context can be thought of as a <strong>logical boundary</strong> within which a particular domain model applies. This boundary includes:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <li><strong>Consistent Terminology:</strong> Every term has a single meaning within the context.</li>
        <li><strong>Defined Rules:</strong> Business rules and behaviors are specific to the context.</li>
        <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> The domain logic is isolated from other contexts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Think of a Bounded Context as a self-contained unit, where a domain model is consistent and meaningful, without conflicting with terms or rules in other parts of the system.

      <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-6">Why Bounded Contexts Matter</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-300 text-center leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Bounded Contexts are essential for managing complexity in large systems. Without them, systems can become messy, with terms
        and behaviors overlapping in unpredictable ways. Here’s what Bounded Contexts help achieve:

          <p class="text-gray-300">
            Each team works within a defined scope, avoiding confusion caused by overloaded terminology.

        <div>
          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Isolation</h4>
          <p class="text-gray-300">
            Domain models remain isolated, reducing the risk of unexpected dependencies between systems.

        <div>
          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Scalability</h4>
          <p class="text-gray-300">
            Teams can scale their systems independently by focusing on their specific context.

      <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-6">Example: Certification Management</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-300 text-center leading-relaxed mb-8">
        At Kalkomey, the Certification Management system is one Bounded Context. It is responsible for issuing certifications to learners
        after course completion and ensuring compliance with state or provincial regulations.
      </p>
      <div class="bg-gray-700 p-6 rounded text-green-400 text-sm overflow-auto">
<pre class="bg-gray-900 p-4 rounded text-green-400">
Bounded Context: Certification Management
- Responsible for issuing certifications and managing expiration dates.
- Terms like "certification," "learner," and "expiration date" have specific meanings.
- Does not handle course creation (handled by the LMS context).
</pre>
      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mt-6 text-center">
        This isolation ensures that the Certification Management system can focus on its responsibilities without being affected by changes in unrelated contexts.
